Tanner PedrettiMatplotlib HW Writeup1. From the boxplot we constructed, we can see that Infubinol and Ceftamin seem to be less effective at reducing tumor size in mice than Capomulin and Ramicane. 2. Additionally, from the scatterplot we constructed we can see that Tumor volume and mouse weight are positively correlated with each other and it seems that as mouse weight increases, Tumor volume increases with it.3. Lastly, we can see that at least for one mouse on Capomulin, tumor size shrank as treatment time increased showing that Capomulin is demonstrating effectiveness at reducing tumor size. This fits along with what our boxplot shows
